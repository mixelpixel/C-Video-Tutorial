>  MinGW : http://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw/
>  
>  In the past week I have been asked a countless number of times how to install GCC ( GNU Compiler Collection ).
>  
>  I show you how to install GCC on Windows as well as on a Mac in the video below. Not only did I make a video, but I also have everything listed step-by-step below after the video. If you have any trouble setting this up, leave a comment below and I'll try to help.

## [C Video Tutorial 01](https://youtu.be/nXvy5900m3M)
>  Get the Code Here: http://goo.gl/u23ZZ
>  
>  Welcome to part 1 of my C Video Tutorial! I have been getting this request constantly lately so I decided to cover the C programming language in a fast and complete tutorial series. It will probably be complete by the end of the weekend!
>  
>  I cover: Comments, #include, #define, Global Variables, main(), char, int, long int, float, double, printf(), Escape Sequences, %d, %ld, %f, %c, %s, Character Arrays (Strings), strcpy, scanf(), Math Functions, Order of Operations, Math Shortcuts, Casting and more...

>  
>  Welcome to part 2 of my C Video Tutorial. If you missed part 1 check it out first.
>  
>  In this part of my C Tutorial I will cover: Compiling Options, Relational Operators, Logical operators, If, Else, Else If, Conditional Operator, Sizeof(), Bytes, Bits, While, Do While, For, Break, Continue and more...

## [C Video Tutorial 03](https://youtu.be/IBr78sxWN2M)
>  Get the Code Here : http://goo.gl/x3oiwE
>

## [C Video Tutorial 04](https://youtu.be/N7MRxREJ4-U)
>  Get the Code Here : http://goo.gl/Q8sGfU
>  
>  Welcome to part 4 of my C Video Tutorial! Today I'm going to try something a little different to try and make the videos feel more like a classroom atmosphere.
>  
>  We'll be looking at pointers in c. I'll cover what pointers are. What is the difference between * and &. How to use pointers and arrays. How to create an array of strings. We'll also look at how to change the value of variables inside of functions and how to manipulate char arrays in functions.

## [C Video Tutorial 05](https://youtu.be/zv8OdxQuUl8)
>  Get the Code Here : http://goo.gl/12DBHg
>  
>  Today I'm going to cover how to create and use a struct in C. Structs are used when you need more then one piece of data to describe one thing. You can't use an array because an array only holds data with the same data type
>  
>  I'll specifically cover how to : Create a Struct, Get data from a Struct, Initialize a Struct, Pass a Struct to a Function, Use Typedef, Change a Value in a Struct, Use a Struct in a Function, ->, \*(structName) and how a Struct is stored in memory.

## [C Video Tutorial 06](https://youtu.be/MjQ6PEQen-Q)
>  Get the Code Here : http://goo.gl/zRT75P
>  
>  Welcome to part 6 of my C video tutorial. Today I'm going to cover Unions, Enumerated Types, the Designated Initializer, Using unions in Structs, Recursive Structures, Linked Lists and much more.
>  
>  I'm also going to experiment with a new style that is more interactive and I hope it feels more like a classroom setting. Throughout the tutorial I will constantly insert brain teasers. Hopefully they aren't distracting. I do this every once in a while to try and improve.

## [C Video Tutorial 07](https://youtu.be/FqpbxjiaB5o)
>  Get the Code Here : http://goo.gl/vLEliW
>  
>  In this tutorial, I'm going to cover a bunch of topics that you have requested and that I have skipped.
>  
>  I cover the following: strchr(), strrchr(), tolower(), toupper(), ctype.h Functions, \_Bool, bool, Numerous Ways to Except Input, getchar(), putchar(), Buffering, gets(), puts(), fgets(), fputs(), How to Eliminate Newline, How to Make a String Lowercase, strcmp() and more.

## [C Video Tutorial 08](https://youtu.be/PYzqi0eOxIg)
>  Welcome to part 8 of my C Video Tutorial. In this video I cover a topic I have received many requests for. This is basically a C Malloc Tutorial.

> Malloc() ( Memory Allocator ) is used to dynamically set aside memory at run time. Because malloc() returns a pointer to that location in memory it can be a bit confusing. I'll cover how to store both regular data types as well as structs using malloc().

## [C Video Tutorial 09](https://youtu.be/muco_oVlNwQ)
>  Get the Code and Transcription : http://goo.gl/3HkALO

>  Welcome to my linked list structure or linked list struct tutorial. I have been asked to cover these structs numerous times lately and so I will do so.
>  
>  In this tutorial and the next I will show how to create an unlimited number of structs using malloc. I'll focus on creating the structs, adding them to the list and then how to display them.
>  
>  Because you guys ask for homework all of the time, you'll then get the opportunity to write the code on how to search through the linked list, how to delete structs and free memory.

## [C Video Tutorial 10](https://youtu.be/aMVuOpdnu3A)
>  Get the Code & Transcription Here : http://goo.gl/H7l1QM
>  
>  In this video I continue with my C Linked List tutorial. In part 9, I gave you homework and in this video I will show you my answer. You guys asked for more tutorials like this, so I'm giving it a try.
>  
>  So, today I'll show you how to search through a Linked List. I'll also cover how to delete structs and remove them not only from the Linked List, but also from memory. All of the code from the video is linked to above along with a transcription.

## [C Video Tutorial 11](https://youtu.be/FioQNaLA2zY)
>  Get the Code & Transcript Here : http://goo.gl/m4mAF6
>  
>  In this part of the C Video Tutorial I will provide C File IO examples. I'll cover C Text File IO in this tutorial and the Binary File IO functions in the next part.
>  
>  I specifically cover the following topics: FILE Data type, fopen(), fputs(), fseek(), ftell(), fgets(), fclose(), fscanf(), puts(), fprintf(), Different Ways to Access Files, and more. All of the code used is available below the video.

## [C Video Tutorial 12](https://youtu.be/oSXIkgCSAoI)
>  Get the Code & Transcription Here : http://goo.gl/y0UBJJ
>  
>  Welcome to my C Binary File IO tutorial. With the binary view of a file you have access to all the bytes in the file. You can store strings, arrays, structs, etc.
>  
>  Aside from showing how to save and retrieve strings, I'll also cover how to save array data and grab it out of the file randomly. I also briefly cover error handling in C.
>  
>  All the code is available above along with a transcript of what I said for translation.

## [C Video Tutorial 13](https://youtu.be/7F_2Jq4L_tA)
>  Get the Code and Transcription Here : http://goo.gl/jdkZqe
>  
>  I have been asked many times to explain how to convert base 10 numbers into binary (Base 2), octal (Base 8) and hexadecimal (Base 16) numbers. Today I'll cover that topic.
>  
>  I also cover how the different numbering systems work so that it will be easy to work with them in the videos that follow. All of the code can be found below along with a transcription to aid in translation.

## [C Video Tutorial 14](https://youtu.be/Ej8iYpTOrlE)
>  Get the Code and Transcription Here : http://goo.gl/ykujrh
>  
>  In the last part of my C Video Tutorial, I covered how to convert from base 10 to base 2, base 8 and base 16 with C.
>  
>  At the end of that tutorial, I provided a homework assignment for you to write code that converts from any base back to base 10. In this tutorial, I will walk through exactly how to do that.
>  
>  You can find all of the code above. Please leave any questions you may have.

## [C Video Tutorial 15](https://youtu.be/fqKiL03afUA)
>  Get the Code and Transcription Here : http://goo.gl/dnDuPg
>  
>  Welcome to part 15 of my C Video Tutorial! In this tutorial, I cover numerous topics.
>  
>  First I go over how we can pass locations in memory between functions based on a request I received. Then I cover the Bitwise Operators AND, OR, Exclusive OR, and Shift Operators. We explore how signed numbers work and how the Ones Complement Operator can help. Then we look at Bit Masking and Binary Fractions.
